			<p>Hi Guys,</p>
			<p>Welcome to Cartrawler. I made this trainer to make studying the SIPP codes a bit less tedious. I hope it helps.</p>
			<p>The program works really simple. First click on 'Start practicing'. Then fill out the text fields accordingly. After you are you filled out the fields, click on 'Check answer and continue'. You will either receive a compliment or encouragement, the correct answer and a new SIPP code. Please be careful, the system is sensitive to spaces between words and signs. Please check the SIPP code sheet you got from Emma and Cian. Good luck!</p>
			<p>I am looking forward to seeing you on the floor soon!</p>
			<p>Kind regards,</p>
